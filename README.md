## Overview

hey my name is yishak and this is my solution to the interactive-rating-component design so enjoy it!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

the process to build the rating is very easy if someone knows how to acess DOM using javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript
- javascript module

### What I learned

these helps me to practice a basics of javascript methods specially forEach method ,by selecting the parent container and then accessing
each and every elment of that item .and also displaying the dataset-id in the result section of card.
the parent container for rating btns is

```html
<h1>
  <div class="rating-container">
    <button class="btn btn-rating" data-id="1">1</button>
    <button class="btn btn-rating" data-id="2">2</button>
    <button class="btn btn-rating" data-id="3">3</button>
    <button class="btn btn-rating" data-id="4">4</button>
    <button class="btn btn-rating" data-id="5">5</button>
  </div>
</h1>
```

and the result card should be set like these by default when we acess the DOM we remove these classlist and then add it to the
rating card thats the whole logic in the css

```css
.hidden {
  opacity: 0;
  display: none;
}
```

the main logic in the js is printing the data-set id of the given btn and then print it to the result card

```js
//remove active state from btns
eachBtns.forEach((btn) => {
  btn.classList.remove('btn-active');
  e.target.classList.add('btn-active');
  textResult.innerHTML = `You selected ${id} out of 5`; //printing the selected value to result
});
```

### Continued development

to be honest i just wanna practice the logic in the rating section(not on these project) is when the user rated first and then when
he/she get back and when they try to rate again to display error message
